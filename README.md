# Ultimate Tic Tac Toe implementation, game agents, heuristics and benchmarking tools

This repository contains an implementation of the Ultimate Tic Tac Toe game, as well as a number of game agents, heuristics and benchmarking tools.

## Game agents

The following game agents are implemented:

- MiniMax agent
- Monte Carlo Tree Search agent
- Random agent
- Human agent
- RandomStart agent
- Benched agent

## Heuristics

The following heuristics are implemented:

- Custom heuristic
- Parameterized heuristic
- Monte Carlo Game Search heuristic

The parameterized heuristic can be used to optimize the weights of the heuristic using a genetic algorithm.

The gene used for the experiments is stored [here](/tests/used%20for%20experiments.gene).
